Sickle cell disease (SCD) poses a significant global health challenge, 
particularly in India and sub-Saharan Africa, where timely diagnosis is 
hindered by limited resources. This paper addresses the need for a cost-effective 
and efficient Sickle Cell disease detection system using Arduino technology. 
Inspired by the NIH (National Institute of Health) initiative, our focus is on 
developing devices that are inexpensive, simple, and practical for limited 
resource settings.

Problem Statement  
The project addresses the challenges of existing diagnostic methods, which rely 
on expensive equipment and trained personnel. Transportation delays and 
central laboratory batching further impede timely results. Our goal is to create 
a system using Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, LEDs, and Photodiode sensors to 
achieve accurate detection, reliable communication, and minimize false 
triggers.
